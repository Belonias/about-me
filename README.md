The group wouldn't be able to grow more than 1000 members without the valuable help of @cripcate @2hands10fingers @danielquinn @mikelane and many more.

The purpose of the group is to provide help to beginners through live support, provide feedback, [monthly challenges](https://github.com/py-study-group/challenges) and [beginner friendly programming excercises](https://github.com/py-study-group/beginner-friendly-programming-exercises)
