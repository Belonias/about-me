# Iakovos Belonias

I am backend developer with experience across a wide range of problem domains. My preferred web framework is Django

I focus on producing secure and maintainable code and it's important to me to think through the implications of adding new features to a code base before the edge cases have to be discovered the hard way.

## pyStudyGroup

pyStudyGroup is a group I created on slack, most of it's users are from [reddit community learn python](https://reddit.com/r/learnpython). [Here is our github repo](https://github.com/py-study-group). The group wouldn't be able to grow more than 1000 members without the valuable help of @cripcate @2hands10fingers @danielquinn @mikelane and many more.

The purpose of the group is to provide help to beginners through live support, provide feedback, [monthly challenges](https://github.com/py-study-group/challenges) and [beginner friendly programming excercises](https://github.com/py-study-group/beginner-friendly-programming-exercises)
